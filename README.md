I want to start a community driven MapHack (+ Extra features).
I hope other people seek interest in this and start grabbing address locations and their original and updated binaries to help develop this.
Currently it's beyond rudimentary, it only shows units in fog and also has them be clickable. No Hotkeys or anything to toggle it yet.

This is built using Xenon's original source as inspiration.
I've personally removed pretty much everything from Xenon's expanded feature list only because I haven't figured out the new addresses and wanted to make sure I understood how to even use the patch function.
C++ is not a language I was taught, so it'd be nice to have someone more fluent come along to help!
The original Xenon code is in the .7z, please use them as reference for what features we want to add.
